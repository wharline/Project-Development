How to Play:

Click on a unit to select it.  A selected unit will be surrounded by a green area indicating how far it can move.

Use W, A, S, D to select a path for the unit to move.  The side panel will show how many spaces left you can move.
Press SPACE to move to the space at the end of your path.  A red area will be shown indicating your attack range.  Click on an enemy unit within this range to attack it and end that unit's turn.

Instead of clicking an enemy unit after moving, you can also press SPACE again to end that unit's turn on that spot.

You can also press S after moving to activate that unit's special move.  The special move is described in the side panel.  Click on a unit within the purple area to use your special on that unit.

If you want to end your turn early, click END TURN in the GAME menu at the top of the screen.
